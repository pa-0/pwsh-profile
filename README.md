## üõ†Ô∏è Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll have two options for installing a font patched to support icons in PowerShell:

### 1) You will find a downloaded `cove.zip` file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the patched `Caskaydia Cove` nerd font family:

1. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
2. Locate and install the nerd fonts.

### 2) With `oh-my-posh` (loaded automatically through the PowerShell profile script hosted on this repo):
1. Run the command `oh-my-posh font install`
2. A list of Nerd Fonts will appear like so:
<pre>
PS> oh-my-posh font install

   Select font

3. With the up/down arrow keys, select the font you would like to install and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
4. DONE!
   
Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! üöÄ
